# Securing virtual machines

Each cloud provider has its own implementation of VMs (or virtual servers). The basic idea remains the same:

1. Select a machine type (or size).
2. Select a preinstalled image of an operating system.
3. Configure storage.
4. Configure network settings.
5. Configure permissions to access cloud resources.
6. Deploy an application.
7. Use the service.
8. Carry out ongoing maintenance of the operating system.

With the shared responsibility model, when using IaaS, we (as the customers) are responsible for the deployment and maintenance of virtual servers.
