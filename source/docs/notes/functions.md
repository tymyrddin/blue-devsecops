# Securing serverless/function as a service

The term serverless or function as a service means that customers of the service, are not in charge of the underlying infrastructure, and just import code (according to the supported language by each cloud provider), select preferred runtime, select amount of required memory per function (affecting the amount of CPU), and set a trigger to invoke the function.
