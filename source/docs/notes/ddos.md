# Securing DDoS protection services

Each cloud provider has its own implementation of a managed DDoS protection service. Because cloud providers have very large bandwidth, they can offer (as a paid service) mechanisms to protect customers' environments from DDoS attacks.

These services can help mitigate DDoS attacks:

* DDoS protection services
* Auto-scaling groups combined with load-balancing services
* CDN services
* WAF services

* [Azure DDoS Protection](../azure/ddos.md)
* [Google Cloud Armor](../gcp/armor.md)
