# Securing CDN services

Each cloud provider has its own implementation of a CDN service for distributing content closer to the customer throughout the entire world. A CDN caches content (such as images, videos, or static web pages) in multiple locations around the world, allowing customers to receive the content quickly from a location close to the customer.

CDNs also serve as an extra defense mechanism against DDoS attacks by being one of the first services that serves a customer's request, even before the request reaches the servers or applications.

* [Azure content delivery network (CDN)](../azure/cdn.md)
* [Google content delivery network (CDN)](../gcp/cdn.md)
