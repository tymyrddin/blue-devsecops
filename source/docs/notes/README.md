# Introduction

## What?

DevOps can mean many different things, depending on which part of information technology (IT) it is being applied to. Here focus is on cloud services and the development and operations of web applications. When DevOps is adopted, security must change its culture to adopt DevOps as well, starting with a focus on the customer.

Instead of security teams focusing on security-centric goals:

* Compliance with a security standard
* Number of security incidents
* Counting unpatched vulnerabilities on production systems

Everyone in the pipeline is focused on the customer:

* Product managers measure engagement and retention ratios.
* Developers measure ergonomics and usability.
* Operators measure uptime and response times.

## Why?

To be able to support the desperate better.
