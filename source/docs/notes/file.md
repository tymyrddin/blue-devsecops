# Securing file storage

File storage is a piece of storage such as the on-premises network-attached storage (NAS). In general, file storage:

* offers support for common file sharing protocols (such as NFS and SMB/CIFS).
* can mount a volume from a managed file service into an operating system to store and retrieve files, for multiple VMs, in parallel.
* can control access permissions to the remote filesystem.
* enables automatic filesystem growth.

* [Azure Files](../azure/files.md)
* [Google Filestore](../gcp/filestore.md)
